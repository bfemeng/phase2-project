### Introduction
Sometimes it is better to have an online record of tasks to take care of and a correct count of item inventory. Task Me is a personal assistant to help you better maintain your business. 


### Installation

To run this program a user needs to have access to the internet and a standard browser.

### Usage

After you are welcomed to the application you can navigate to eithe the Inventory tab or the TodoList tab. To add inventory items simply click into the "Add an Item" field and type your item. When you click the plus icon you will see your item appear added to the list. If you would like to add more than 1 you can click on the right arrow on the item line. You will see ther count increase. To subtract items you can click on the left arrow. Placing a click on the circle allows you to mark that item as complete if you have counted all of your inventory. By clicking on the TodoList tab you enter the todolist portion of the app. Click into the "Start Typimg..." field and click "Add to List" or press the enter button to add items to the list. 

### Known Issues and limitations

You cannot delete items added to the Todolist. It is a functionality I plan to implement at a later time.

### Contributing

A huge thank you to each of the Flatiron school staff that helped me when I was stuck on a line of code or had trouble executing a concept. Special recognition to my Cohort Lead Nancy Noyes as she often planted me in front of the "I believe" button so I could confidently push it when I didn't feel so confident in my abilities to produce a functioning beginner's app.
